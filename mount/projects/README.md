Your Project root directory should be mounted here.

It must have a hence.yml file present to determine what folders to mount, and what type of mounting to use for each.  A sample example.hence.yml file can be found in this directory as a reference.

Any files or folders placed in this directory will be available in the VM at /hence/[project_machine_name].
